**Squarie - an open-source android arcade game by Edvinas Kilbauskas**

Pardon the lack of documentation and horrible coding.
This project wasn't meant to be open-source at the beginning of its creation, but after finishing it, publishing to Google Play and seeing it fail misserably I decided that it might serve a better purpose being an open-source game for people to learn from. Afterall there aren't so many original open-source games for android, and I just want to do a good cause for the open-source game dev community.
